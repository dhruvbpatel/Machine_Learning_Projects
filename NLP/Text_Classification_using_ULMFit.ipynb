It depends upon serious advanced application is. True immersive visualization (VR), requires rendering complex visual databases anywhere 20 60 newly rendered frames per second. This similar requirement traditional flight simulators pilot training. If frame rate low, user notices stepping frames move head rapidly around scene, motion graphics smooth contiguous. Thus graphics system must powerful enough sustain high frame rates rendering complex data representations. Additionally, frame rate must constant. If system renders 15 frames per second one point, 60 frames per second next (perhaps due scene new viewing direction simpler visible before), user get heavily distracted medium (the graphics computer) rather focusing data. To maintain constant frame rate, system must able run real-time. UNIX general support real-time operation, Silicon Graphics modified UNIX kernel multi-processor systems able support real-time operation, bypassing usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time operation (not Sun SPARC10, HP 700 Series systems, IBM RS-6000, even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo Crimson). Only multiprocessor Onyx Challenge systems support real-time operation due Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.

The 1992 Olympic teams contained much talent average expansion team. Canada Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau Chris Kontos. Another four five deep subs NHL.

Here THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think NHL-based players: (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player) FINLAND: D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13 C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16 R-Teemu Selanne.....27 L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selanne\\'s ratings would higher today January) SWEDEN: D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7 C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18 R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13 L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14 This would interesting.

The FLYERS never led point game. For Whalers, loss marked NHL record 9th OT loss season. Roster move: Gord Hynes called play place Ryan McGill Injuries: Ryan McGill injured hand fight 4/15 scratched. Lines: Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes Dominic Roussel Game Summary: I get TV coverage game, since stormy parts I best radio coverage either. Here's box score followed things I pick up: First Period: Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51 Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp) Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda, Har (interference) 18:43 Second Period: Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00 Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09 Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38 Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski, Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50 Third Period: Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp) Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11 Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38 Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30 Overtime: Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15. Penalties - None Power Play: Philadelphia 1 4, Hartford 1 4 Goalies: Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33) On first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed puck FLYERS blue line Nylander stripped took off. The Recchi goal 2 1 Lindros. The Bowen goal puck threw net, got good carom ended behind goalie. On second Nylander goal got three whacks puck went in. This frustrating part FLYERS defense. Take body, get one shot beat fine. Don't give another chance. Carkner, Galley McGill terrible this, I'll bet money least one closest FLYER play. That's I have, radio got bad I lucky know scored, much less how. From I heard, Roussel strong game. After game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor pick three stars season rather game. It Garry Galley #3 career high point total (I'm surprised former goalie look closer defensive play), Tommy Soderstrom #2 team record tying 5 shutouts 1/2 season and, Mark Recchi #1 time high team single season scoring mark. But here's odd part. He decide Lindros Recchi number 1. If picks Recchi #1 hard time choosing Lindros, make Lindros #2???? What? You wanna know three stars season? Well, since asked... #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates game simply stepping onto ice. The difference team's record without accident. I believe team could almost successful without Recchi. There question team significantly better Eric Lindros it, I think deservedly wear 'C' jersey next season. #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts second league Ed Belfour, Tommy Chris Chelios (booo) front him. He also play complete season due heart problems (sentimental edge here, family history heart problems). There's question mind Tommy Soderstrom teams goalie future, Roussel complains number 2 look traded within 2 years. #3 Mark Recchi. Again, can't argue all-time team high single season scoring mark. There awful lot teams single player get many points. Plus, Mark FLYER play entire season. Not tough choice. Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped single season high point total set last year. The difference top line year get much playing time. Then again, get defensive attention got last year team either. Dimtri Yushkevich teams consistent defenseman. Yes, made rookie mistakes, usually fast enough make them. I feeling shot he'll score points next year without giving anything zone, I suspect he'll teams top defenseman years come. Garry Galley team's point leader defensemen. Again, things can't argue with. And battled chronic fatigue syndrome, certainly deserves kudos missing one game, wishes doctors orders. But defensive play often negates offensive contribution. A little caution, little bit smarter end make much important part team next year. Brent Fedyk leagues biggest improvement last years point total. But consistency became problem him.

Tommy Soderstrom get credit shutout, barely broke sweat third period FLYERS defense kept Leafs mounting serious attack. Injuries: Pelle Eklund day-to-day bruised thigh. Roster Moves: Jason Bowen added lineup first NHL game. Jason FLYERS second pick first round (15th overall) 1992 entry draft. 19 years old, 6\\'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games tri-city Americans 10 goals, 12 assists 219 PIM. He plays left wing defense, played defense game although Bobby Taylor said Bill Dineen planning use front well. Andre Faust returned Hershey. He actually left second period Kings game, flew Albany, got game tying goal Bears OT win, played Hershey Sunday night. Lines: Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom goal. Acton replaced Lomakin 3rd period. Game Summary: If FLYERS played like every night, they\\'d playoffs year. The FLYERS hit everything moved. They created scoring chance scoring chance. They snuffed everything Leafs tried do. Jason Bowen made good play first NHL shift almost created goal. He puck top left offensive circle alone, instead taking shot found Brind\\'Amour crashing net side. A perfect pass good shot across Daren Puppa\\'s body goal, Puppa made great save reading play. Garry Galley gave Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play first chance hooked Doug Gilmour 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit almost flawless entire game, set tone kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing long unscreened shots, defense swept away every rebound. After power play, FLYERS got goal ugly play. Rod Brind\\'Amour gave puck Greg Hawgood right point, sent drive net. Puppa made save kicked rebound right feet Josef Beranek Bob Rouse, wrestling slot. Beranek able get stick puck push Dineen skating slot right circle, lifted backhander Puppa 1-0 FLYERS lead 8:10. The FLYERS kept pressure on, Puppa Leaf keeping FLYERS building lead while. Eventually things settled defense prevailed. Each team got occasional scoring chance, goalies strong. Bowen started giving Lindros-like checks corners. Then Lindros, looking avenge hit Foligno gave him, thought chance even score. He Foligno lined center ice, leaned him, rode center ice boards. The problem Foligno little far boards, Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt warranted boarding call 15:38 The Leafs get anything going power play FLYERS aggressive (for change) kill. With time running period, Recchi carried neutral zone handed Lindros approached Leaf\\'s blue line. They crowd Wendell Clark Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried backhand pass Recchi feet Macoun connected Recchi, Clark checked Recchi puck. Macoun tried clear, weak went right McGill manned point. He drove inside blue line. Macoun got stick deflected past goalie 19:55.1. Shots 13-8 FLYERS period. The FLYERS finally got first chance power play Dave Andreychuk tripped Rod Brind\\'Amour offensive zone. During power play, FLYERS got cheated little puck popped air Eric gloved down, McGeough thought hit stick head. We could see seats end ice hit glove replay confirmed, faceoff went end. As time running advantage, Lindros found Galley pass across goal mouth Puppa made save. The rebound kicked back right corner Recchi picked up, passed Eric crashing right circle, Eric one-timed past Puppa 7:55. With assist, Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, second best one season total FLYER 117. Eric moves 4th time FLYERS rookie scoring 67 points. Mike Eastwood took Al Conroy 8:30 give FLYERS another chance power play. Not much pressure Garry Galley ended power play slash 9:19. Not much happened 4 4, although Leafs possession. The FLYERS smothered Leafs short power play. Tempers flared little 13:14. Bowen Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton got bloody face. Dave McLlwain took dive got Greg Hawgood hooking minor 13:46 set 4 3. The replay showed Hawgood\\'s stick stopped making contact McLlwain long spun around fell. Again FLYERS smothered Leafs power play, led Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made thundering hit came box Pearson. Berehowski tried perplex everybody sloooowball. He puck point, trickled pass slot. He made FLYERS look silly nobody could get stick it, got Gilmour side net, Soderstrom stoned him. The FLYERS picked things offensively kill over, get anything home. Shots 13-10 FLYERS. The FLYERS content 3 goal lead third period, decided Tommy wanted shutout, going work little. The FLYERS got scoring chances first 7 minutes period, get past Puppa. Then Leafs got tired Lindros making road kill them, tempers flared. 2 Doug Gilmour Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) 2 Glenn Anderson McGill (roughing) 7:02. Terry Carkner took kneeing penalty 7:51 Gilmour. Again FLYERS smothered Leafs power play. At 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got shot away left circle got Soderstrom. The puck rolling side, luck would turned away net instead turning towards (think rolling quarter inevitably starts lean one way other). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped Gilmour 12:24 give Leafs another chance power play. On advantage, Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk lying down, Andreychuk got rebound Soderstrom, behind net went straight swept away one defensemen. They kept pressure on, Soderstrom equal preserved shutout. Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner get tempers hot start brawl 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got initial minor, Krushelnyski Baumgartner Lindros got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse Beranek expressed mutual dislike got 2 slashing set another 4 4. Mike Eastwood shoved Ryan McGill FLYERS zone battling puck, McGill ran stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS happy all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired 6-1 Berehowski, started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held own, much delight crowd. Each got couple punches going head, Al got standing O! Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski Conroy 5 (fighting) 17:49. So major penalty rest game FLYERS. The interest stting lead. Hawgood, Galley Brind\\'Amour played catch Hawgood found Dineen alone left circle, controlled puck blasted past Puppa 18:39. That fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would face another shot. Puppa did, kept FLYERS board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots 9-8 FLYERS 3rd. Probably strongest game I\\'ve seen FLYERS since All Star break. Shutout number 4 Soderstrom, since 1/10. Tied 2nd NHL, he\\'s played fewer games Belfour (6) goalie I can\\'t remember he\\'s tied with. Next Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot eliminated win, loss coupled Islander win night Washington would official end. FLYERS 71 points season 78 games. Last year 75 points 80 games (5 .500), need least 8 points last 6 games improve percentage points (5 84 better 5 80). Tragic number holds 3 points 6 games left. The tragic number 5th 5 points, I watched Rangers blow 4-2 third period lead home lose 5-4 I finished up. Why 5 points instead 4? Well, FLYERS win tie-breaker catch them, whereas Islanders win tie breakers FLYERS need tie. The Rangers could crumble stretch play Devils, Pens twice, FLYERS, finish 2 games Caps. So I guess 5th place could goal team focus on.

Whether Kings \\'winner\\' debatable.

Anyway, McNall heavy marketing around Gretzky, undoubtedly also responsible attendance merchandising sales, etc. But I said, Kings little tailspins past couple years empty seats Forum even tickets sold.

Alexander Mogilny led comeback scoring 75th 76th goals season tied game 3 2nd period 4 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 45 shots goal improve record 20-17-6 tested Mogilny LaFontaine night. Roster move: Andre Faust recalled Hershey, Shawn Cronin healthy scratch. Lines: Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary: Say, anybody Buffalo reading this, people get woman sang anthems? We turn volume! The FLYERS defense started game showing everybody FLYERS shutting teams lately holding Sabres 8 shots first period. They showed everybody playing golf Sunday gave 37 shots last two periods. Maybe Tommy told getting bored back there... Mark Recchi opened scoring fast blinked missed it. After Buffalo faceoff dumped, Tommy wrapped puck around boards Eric 1/2 way left. Eric dropped Galley, sent ahead Recchi steaming zone. Mark skated center circle, passed puck legs Richard Smehlik, skated around Fuhr. Smehlik pulling way zone stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, slid puck back right past Fuhr 1-0 FLYERS lead 0:18. It beautiful Eric Garry turn assists :-). The FLYERS kept pressure Fuhr that, strong kept FLYERS damage. The game became defensive struggle while. The Sabres got first chance power play Terry Carkner took boarding minor 10:26 crunching Dale Hawerchuk boards FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got scoring chance, terribly good one, FLYERS smothered Sabres power play. Mogilny got post over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill FLYERS. Keith Carney took holding penalty 13:31 taking Mark Recchi give FLYERS power play. The best penalty killing team league allow FLYERS shot goal, although FLYERS create good scoring chance Lindros partially fanned shot. Towards end period play started going end end, everybody kept missing net. Greg Hawgood took interference penalty 18:19 give Sabres another power play, get anything going fans expressed displeasure, particularly iced puck. Shots 8-6 Buffalo FLYERS led 6-2 one point. Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider periods. Jay disappointed make playoffs, discouraged. This considered rebuilding year *The Trade* seemed happy way season went. When asked agonized *The Trade* said Russ Farwell\\'s trade his, issue Ed Snider far money. But yes, agonizing, they\\'d again. When asked coaching situation would handled next year said Russ\\' call, Russ evaluate things end season. He feels they\\'re 3 years away shot Cup. He expects get playoffs next year, shot division title following year, shot finals year that. This based current level play anticipated improvements summer. He\\'s happy re-alignment (he called \"outstanding\"). Happy current expansion, feels talent pool big enough unflux Europeans, feels must make sure existing franchises stable. Seemed like idea playing Olympics (booo) said definite split among owners certainly would happen four years consensus. The Sabres gave FLYERS second power play game Brad May took tripping penalty 0:51 second. The FLYERS little trouble getting started, eventually did. Hawgood took pass moving throug neutral zone handed puck Eklund outside Sabres blue line along right boards. Eklund carried zone nad passed across Dineen tried one timer blue line top left circle. He half fanned it, sent puck trickling slot. Fuhr know was, though, Hawgood race flipped essentially open net 2:15. Then Mogilny breakaway. He slipped two FLYERS blue line went Soderstrom. He went backhander, Soderstrom it. The FLYERS took bad discipline type penalties really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took double minor roughing high sticking Barnaby got skin drew one minor, according Gary Dornhoefer took dive get (there video) 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t get started. Ryan McGill poked puck Sabre carried FLYERS zone, bunch people poked Dineen emerged headed way. It started 1 1, Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead make 2 1 back defenseman. Dineen let rip top right circle make 3-0 FLYERS 5:40. That Fuhr, John Muckler sent Dominik Hasek take over. But Sabres still lots power play time. Again took time get FLYERS zone, finally FLYERS them. Boos began ring building. But finally got Soderstrom ugly goal. Smehlik took shot top zone missed kicked Hawerchuk slot. Hawerchuk tried backhander skated towards goal line right Galley dove block it. Mistake #1, let Soderstrom handle backhander worried A) rebound B) Barnaby camped behind goal line right next net. Well, rebound dropped right next Soderstrom, mistake #2, Galley laid watched Barnaby get THREE hacks puck finally pushed goalie. He even swing stick try knock puck away. With goal, 7:48, two streaks end FLYERS. 150:28 shutout hockey, 27 straight penalty kills. Lindros put right back power play 8:36 high sticking minor, I think Barnaby again. This time Sabres able get set quickly, get much quality goal. The Sabres continued keep puck FLYERS end power play ended. Things evetually settled down, bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby get skin slashed stick faceoff. The gloves dropped, McGill started pounding crap him. But fight, gave Barnaby head butt helmet, meant match penalty. 2 slashing, 5 fighting 5 major, 7 minutes power play time Sabres 14:15, Barnaby got 5. The FLYERS keeping bay while, long could that. After couple good Sabre chances, Audette handed Ledyard point, Ledyard sent drive knocked Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked bouncing puck left side net, knocked Randy Wood right. Soderstrom moved play LaFontaine, since Yushkevich Carkner waving puck instead picking men, Wood slid empty net 17:34 close FLYERS lead 3-2. LaFontaine actually trying put net, half fanned got break. The FLYERS got shorthanded pressure Sabres zone, Hasek strong. Finally Keith Carney passing ahead Hawerchuk neutral zone, Hawerchuk sent good backhand pass Mogilny FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway Mogilny, elected shoot left circle, threaded needle get inside far post 18:56 75th season. Ironically, youth hockey tip 1st second period Tommy Soderstrom talking cutting angles... That 2nd, shots 19-7 Sabres. Into 3rd period, Pelle EKlund blew golden opportunity get FLYERS lead back. A 2 1, Acton puck, dropped Eklund slot, Eklund held puck slid left circle almost angle shoot from. When finally shoot, hit far post. That still carryover power play time. Than incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi Hawgood untouched Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes puck Soderstrom, black object hits back net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But video replay booth, strange reason, meantime Emrick Dornhoefer try figure could reviewing. Well, turns taped stick blade went net, puck. Emrick mentions one criteria scoring goal puck must go net... Dave Hannan took Recchi got holding minor 2:35. The FLYERS could get anything going all. They finally got set 1/2 way through, kept perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped puck Sabre offensive zone along right boards passed across Eklund top left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading net inside right circle passed him. Dineen fumbled pass, twice directed Hasek, Eklund swooped chipped bouncing puck goalie 11th 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS. But Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked puck offensive left corner slid Bob Erry behind FLYERS net. Erry started skate out, dropped puck back nobody behind net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, stuffed Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole 76th 5:24 tie game 4. Then Hawerchuk took retaliatory roughing penalty 5:55. The FLYERS set Sabres zone, stayed there. Off faceoff high Sabres zone middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled puck, Dineen snuck line wristed perfect shot low Hasek\\'s glove side 6:44. Play started go back forth Hawgood took roughing penalty 8:19. The FLYERS dumped puck Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour Ledyard went it, Rod got puck. He backed away right boards, skated right faceoff dot, passed legs Dineen crashing slot himself. Dineen waited patiently lifted blocker Hasek 6-4 FLYERS lead 8:39. 3rd hat trick season Dineen, 7th career, 2nd shorthanded goal game 35th season. Then Carney took tripping penalty 9:02 kill rest Sabres power play. Not much action 4 4, Sabres got chances FLYERS resulting power play. Play went end end quite goalies make big saves. The Sabres able pull Hasek time running FLYERS allow consistant possession Sabres. Finally time running Ken Sutton misplayed puck left corner Brind\\'Amour stripped away him. He pulled away found Dineen side left circle, Dineen found Acton right Hasek. He slid puck two Sabres defenders, Acton chipped back far side Hasek 8th season 19:48 35th birthday. That scoring, shots 18-13 Buffalo, ice showered plastic drinking mugs handed game. So another strong game Tommy Soderstrom tested much last couple starts. Kevin Dineen career high 6 point night (unless better night earlier season, I think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak 3 years, 30 goals 11 three shutouts. Eric Lindros 8th league 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games injury. 4 points 4th, clinched 5th place since Rangers lose tie breaker. A couple misc notes: Forget Mike Keenan rumors, press conference tommorrow announce head coach New York Rangers next year. In last notes I mentioned Garry Galley Barry Ashbee Award, I failed mention award best defenseman. The Times Trenton reported \"a preeminent specialist Oklahoma\" looked Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record determined tests necessary near future. Same paper blurb Bill Dineen asked whether expected back next year. His response wants come back, feels good job year, would cheerfully accept role scouting Farwell want back.

              " 'ell, Patrick Division got little interesting last night. The Islanders lost OT Devils tied Pens. That means Isles beat Devils Friday, meet Caps playoffs. However, I comments Islanders hockey general I need get chest :). First all, Islanders back-to-back lackluster performances Whalers, one may think Islanders shape. These guys always suck wind 2nd period, come little 3rd run gas soon. It unbelieveable many one goal games guys lost. Anyway, games pretty wide open. The Isles still tons trouble scoring. The Whalers played golie 1st NHL start, I think name Lenarduzzi (sp?). (His NHL debut Tuesday tie Isles). Like I mentioned before, guy looked like best golie planet (until misplayed Mahlakov slap shot go OT). I say Isles shoot correctly. Has anyone else noticed this? Also, I think really shame hockey I guy like Mick Vukota gets much ice time does. This guy much hockey talent Jiggs MacDonald (who play hockey, I think). Anytime gets puck gets stolen, always starts fights gets needless penalties. Richard Pilon another guy ice stir crap. And he\\'s defenseman. He\\'s got approaching negative infinity plus/minus. This guy gets beaten time. Why need \"enforcers\"? Not fights slow game ALOT, takes away guys really trying play game. I\\'ll one admit, I enjoy good fight while, \"called for\". You know, guy checks goalie hard. In words, violation \"hockey ethics\" might cause get puched. But need start crap losing becuase get away it!! Does anyone agree referees need little less lenient 3rd OT? I mean COME ON already. I\\'m sick seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. becuase referee call it. OT late 3rd time strategy, physical prowess. Trying set goal first foremost. If afraid team going score pull guy prevent it, deserve win first place. Just My Honest Opinion,',\n",

Sorry that. #8 LARRY DEPALMA Season: 3rd Acquired: \\'91-92, free agent Minnesota Grade: I (C-/D+) No netter/fan watching Sharks, including me, knows DePalma end season; Sharks appeared still rights, San Jose, Kansas City, name appeared waiver wire. And kind invisibility prevalent part DePalma. After called October 30 Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma excellent week, scoring 5 points 3 games playing good defense. Unfortunately, 27-year-old DePalma disappeared rest way, getting 3 points 15 games, generally looked lethargic uninterested ends ice. He sent Kansas City, walked there, suspended later reinstated revealed injured; promptly disappeared watching eyes Shark Bytes (as mailing list known Sharks officials) faithful, neither Sharks miss him. #10 JOHAN GARPENLOV Season: 3rd Acquired: \\'91-92, trade Detroit D Bob McGill 8th round pick \\'92 entry draft Vancouver Grade: A/A- After early slump, Garpenlov nothing short inspirational rest way, finishing 66 points 79 games, second highest total team, clicked well team MVP Kelly Kisio right wing Rob Gaudreau. Kisio got credit, Garpenlov, finishing second MVP voting, clearly demonstrated playmaking scoring skills, seen making excellent centering passes well finishing passes putting puck past opposing goaltenders, getting club-high 14 power- play goals. Contrary previous rep, Garpenlov also showed despite small size (5\\' 11\", 183 lbs.), willing throw around necessary, albeit successful yet. He also still needs work defense, although improved tremendously throughout season, actually quite good penalty killer end season. He major key offense next year. #15 DAVID BRUCE Season: 5th Acquired: \\'91-92, St. Louis expansion draft Grade: I (?) After banner \\'91-92, led team power-play goals (10) third total scoring (38 points 60 games), Bruce bothered virtually season groin injury, kept lineup 17 games season. Of course, difficult speculate well would done season affected injury, 28-year-old Bruce effective man man short Sharks\\' first season, expected strong offensive leader season well. The injury appears serious, shame, otherwise may much brighter future now; instead, future Sharks next season appears clouded. #18 MARK PEDERSON Season: 3rd Acquired: \\'92-93, trade Philadelphia C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade: I (B) It difficult understand Flyers\\' decision unload Pederson, good offensive season last season (40 points 58 games), riding pine early season, Pederson summarily sent Sharks exchange defensive-minded Snuggerud, finished 41 games combined Flyers Sharks. He also limited injuries season, limited production (17 points). But healthy, Pederson appears impressive, good scoring touch, good size (and willingness throw around, although he\\'s considered physical forward), good speed. He also appear liability defense, Sharks probably wait next season see much, exactly, Pederson do. #20 JOHN CARTER Season: 4th Acquired: \\'91-92, free agent Boston Grade: I (B+/B) Carter definitely one hardest workers team, hard work worked wonders, times looked great ice. However, although look great times, fact received 16 points (in 55 games) efforts sign much hard work do, Sharks confirmed sending Kansas City 20 games left season. Carter, turn 30 May 6, always hussled, result, sometimes trapped deep within offensive zone forechecking, generally credit defensive end, probably limited utility capacity, impress offensively, although one best Sharks drawing penalties. He unlikely back next season. #28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season: 1st Acquired: \\'91-92, Minnesota dispersal draft Grade: I (B+/B) I understand Sharks let Quintin play 14 games played season. He generally hard-working creating opportunities offensively, appeared, age 23, ready regular NHL duty, least team like Sharks, finishing 7 points 14 games defensive liability. Shoulder injury training camp \\'91-92 season limited Quintin, team\\'s leading scorer exhibition games despite sitting final two, 29 games Sharks Blades season, looked impressive. He solid contender regular duty next season. #41 MARK BEAUFAIT Season: 1st Acquired: 2nd round pick 1991 supplemental draft Grade: I (?) After all-star season Kansas City, Beaufait got cup coffey Sharks late season Blades knocked playoff spot Sharks decimated injuries, playing 5 games scoring goal NHL point thus far. Despite small size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait shy throw around necessary, looked pretty good times, although early judge based 5 NHL games, played mostly left wing, away center position Northern Michigan Kansas City. #42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season: 1st Acquired: 8th round pick 1991 entry draft Grade: I (?) Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away normal position cup tea (7 games) midway season. He generally much defensive liability, show much offensively either, although may indicative lack ice time got 7 games. He may need another season work defense, defense acceptable, ready. #44 MICHEL PICARD Season: 1st Acquired: \\'92-93, trade Hartford LW Yvon Corriveau Grade: I (B-/C+) The 23-year-old Picard, although perennially tore minors, seems close chances, reason, acquired Sharks failing impress management 25 games, scoring 4 goals points, spent rest way Kansas City.

The program loads images minimum resolution 64 64, pixel depth 8, 16, 32 bits, one image plane. Standard input output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, AIPD. Other formats imported. Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial linear non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic logic operations, geometric transformations, among others. Morphological transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole removal, object separation, extraction skeletons, among others. Quantitative analysis provides objects\\' detection, measurement, morphological distribution. Measures include area, perimeter, center gravity, moment inertia, orientation, length relevant chords, shape factors equivalence. Measures saved ASCII format. The program also provides macro scripting integration custom modules. A 3-D view command plots perspective data graph image intensity depicted mountains valleys plot. The histogram tool plotted either linear logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight arithmetic logical operations provide for: masking averaging sections images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. There 13 spatial filters alter pixel intensities based local intensity. These include high-pass filters contrast outlines. The frequency data resulting FFT analysis displayed either (real , imaginary ) components (phase, magnitude) data. The morphological transformations useful data sharpening defining objects removing artifacts. The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating even hole filling. The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area, perimeter, center mass, object counts, angle points.

Finally, three penalties, network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, Marv Levy, among others) able tell viewers happened PA announcer says it. Oh, one rule. When goal scored (10-20 times period), play cannot resume PA announcer announces it. This way, network sneak commercials. Then, PA announcer told scored, TV announcer tell viewer, even chance pronouncing name right. Seriously, though, I actually went see NBA basketball game last week, first time life. I amazed boring was. The play slow actually fans come things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course 'Laker Girls' get routines least 6-8 times game, periods either. There whistle every 30 seconds average, maybe less. The game 48 minutes, 2 minutes quarters 1-2 3-4 10 minute halftime, still takes 2 hours. The reason TV. There plenty room throw commercials, announcer jabber nothing else happening. On TV, basketball fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, better watch TV there. If road NHL following, truly sad day.

To start with, lines polygons semi-algebraic sets contain uncountable number points. Here off-the-cuff ideas. First, need check line polygon separated. Now, Jordan curve separation theorem says polygon divides plane exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions. Thus, line lies completely inside polygon, line lies completely outside polygon, possibly (but rarely happen) line intersects polyon. Now, phrasing question says \"if line intersects polygon\", decision problem. One possibility (the decision model approach) reduce question (well known) problem Q, try solve Q. An answer Q gives answer original decision problem. In recent years, many geometric problems successfully modeled new language called PostScript. (See \"PostScript Language\", Adobe Systems Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985). So, given line L polygon P, write PostScript program draws line L polygon P, \"outputs\" answer. By \"output\", mean program executes command called \"showpage\", actually prints page paper containing line polygon. A quick examination paper provides answer reduced problem Q, thus original problem. There two small problems approach. (1) There infinite number ways encode L P reduced problem Q. So, forced invoke Axiom Choice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma). But use Axiom Choice regarded serious light days. (2) More importantly, question arises whether PostScript program Q actually output piece paper; words, halt? Now, PostScript expressive enough encode everything Turing Machine might do; thus halting problem (for PostScript) undecidable. It quite possible original problem turn undecidable.

This leads significantly superior quality dithered image (I claim, judge yourself). Restricted color-space means U V components clipped +/-0.25 (instead +/-0.5) display color-space points distributed restricted space. Since distance color-space points thus reduced factor two, color resolution doubled expense able represent fully saturated colors. Saturation dominant ordered dither method color, lying somewhere points display color space, approximated primarily alternating two points constant hue instead constant saturation.

If get reply, server may misreading return address; add line \"path myname@mysite\" specify correct e-mail address reply to. ---------- [1] What JPEG? JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images \"natural\", real-world scenes. It work well non-realistic images, cartoons line drawings. JPEG handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing types images worked committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG \"lossy\", meaning image get decompression quite identical originally put in. The algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact small color details perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images looked humans. If plan machine-analyze images, small errors introduced JPEG may problem you, even invisible eye. A useful property JPEG degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means image maker trade file size output image quality. You make *extremely* small files mind poor quality; useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, happy output quality default compression setting, jack quality satisfied, accept lesser compression. [2] Why use JPEG? There two good reasons: make image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller big win transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress 2 Mbyte full-color file 100 Kbytes makes big difference disk space transmission time! (If comparing GIF JPEG, size ratio like four one. More details below.) If viewing software support JPEG directly, convert JPEG format viewing manipulating images. Even JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give time order store transmit image cheaply. It\\'s worth noting network phone transmission involved, time savings transferring shorter file much greater extra time decompress file. I\\'ll let arithmetic yourself. The reason JPEG gradually replace GIF standard Usenet posting format JPEG store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead 8 less (256 fewer colors). If 8-bit display hardware may seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit GIF look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section 7, JPEG far useful GIF exchanging images among people widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably appropriate GIF use Usenet posting standard. [3] When I use JPEG, I stick GIF? JPEG *not* going displace GIF entirely; types images, GIF superior image quality, file size, both. One first things learn JPEG kinds images apply to. As rule thumb, JPEG superior GIF storing full-color gray-scale images \"realistic\" scenes; means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even 24-bit display hardware, LOT superior do. (See section 7 details.) GIF significantly better images distinct colors, cartoons line drawings. In particular, large areas pixels *exactly* color compressed efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can\\'t squeeze files much GIF without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders quite cheap GIF files, avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time sharp edges: row pure-black pixels adjacent row pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless use high quality setting. Again, sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc. The blurriness particularly objectionable text that\\'s pixels high. If GIF lot small-size overlaid text, JPEG it. Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall scanned images cartoons terms complexity. The complex subtly rendered image, likely JPEG well it. The goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images never converted JPEG. You need least 16 gray levels JPEG useful gray-scale images. It also noted GIF lossless gray-scale images 256 levels, JPEG not. If existing library GIF images, may wonder whether convert JPEG. You lose little image quality do. (Section 7, argues JPEG image quality superior GIF, applies formats start full-color original. If start GIF, already irretrievably lost great deal information; JPEG make things worse.) However, disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This decision make yourself. If convert GIF library JPEG, see section 14 hints. Be prepared leave images GIF format, since GIFs convert well. [4] How well JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here sample file sizes image I handy, 727x525 full-color image ship harbor. The first three files comparison purposes; rest created free JPEG software described section 6B. File Size bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file PPM format (no compression; 24 bits 3 bytes per pixel, plus bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed Unix compress compress accomplish lot, note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif 240438 Converted GIF ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most savings result losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, 24. (See sec. 7.) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 (highest useful quality setting) This indistinguishable 24-bit original, least nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 (default setting) You look mighty darn close distinguish original, even on-screen once. ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This slight defects; know look for, could tell JPEGed without seeing original. Still good image quality many recent postings Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I\\'ve seen plenty Usenet postings poorer image quality this. ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, perfectly satisfactory preview indexing purposes. Note file TINY: compression ratio original 173:1 ! In case JPEG make file that\\'s factor four five smaller GIF comparable quality (the -Q 75 file every bit good GIF, better full-color display). This seems typical ratio real-world scenes. [5] What good \"quality\" settings JPEG? Most JPEG compressors let pick file size vs. image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting. There seems widespread confusion meaning settings. \"Quality 95\" NOT mean \"keep 95% information\", claimed. The quality scale purely arbitrary; percentage anything. The name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) decompresses image indistinguishable original. This setting vary one image another one observer another, rules thumb. The default quality setting (-Q 75) often best choice. This setting lowest go without expecting see defects typical image. Try -Q 75 first; see defects, go up. Except experimental purposes, never go -Q 95; saying -Q 100 produce file two three times large -Q 95, hardly better quality. If image less perfect quality begin with, might able go -Q 50 without objectionable degradation. On hand, might need go HIGHER quality setting avoid degradation. The second case seems apply much time converting GIFs JPEG. The default -Q 75 right compressing 24-bit images, -Q 85 95 usually better converting GIFs (see section 14 info). If want small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, -Q setting range 5 10 right. -Q 2 may amusing \"op art\". (Note: quality settings discussed article apply free JPEG software described section 6B, many programs based it. Other JPEG implementations, Image Alchemy, may use completely different quality scale. Some programs even provide numeric scale, \"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.) [6] Where I get JPEG software? Most programs described section available FTP.

If copy couple months old, get latest JPEG FAQ news.answers archive. [6A] If looking \"canned\" software, viewers, etc: The first part list system-specific programs run one kind system. If see want machine, check portable JPEG software described end list. Note list concentrates free shareware programs obtain Internet; commercial programs listed too. X Windows: John Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 up) excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, image formats. It\\'s available FTP export.lcs.mit.edu ftp.cis.upenn.edu. The file called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? version number, currently 2.21); located \\'contrib\\' directory export \\'pub/xv\\' directory upenn. XV reduces images 8 bits internally, means real good choice 24-bit display (you\\'ll still get 8-bit color). Also, use XV convert full-color images JPEG, they\\'ll get color-quantized first. But XV fine tool converting GIF 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: glitch versions 2.21 earlier: sure check \"save normal size\" checkbox saving JPEG file, file blurry. Another good choice X Windows John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package, also available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; colormapped displays, better (though slower) color quantization XV basic free JPEG software. Both large, complex packages. If want simple image viewer, try xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z. xli variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster robust original. (The current xli indeed faster robust current xloadimage, least respect JPEG files, IJG v4 decoder xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over v1. The next xloadimage release fix this.) xli also free available export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS; Windows OS/2 programs, see next headings. One good choice Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, views JPEG GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, available FTP sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip. This good basic viewer works either 286 386/486 machines. The user interface flashy, functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview. The current version, 1.2, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires 386 better CPU VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work; Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images bigger screen. For larger images, scales image fit screen (rather using panning/scrolling viewers do). You may may prefer approach, there\\'s denying slows loading large images considerably. Note: installation bit tricky; read directions carefully! A shareware alternative ColorView DOS ($30). This easier install either two freeware alternatives. Its user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find harder use --- keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. It faster DVPEG little slower Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem speed, faster Hiview.) The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver; one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip directory. (Many recent PCs built-in VESA driver, try load VESA driver unless ColorView complains driver missing.) A second shareware alternative Fullview, kicking around net while, I know stable archive location it. The current (rather old) version inferior viewers anyway. The author tells new version Fullview shortly submitted Simtel20 archives time. The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation good: slow (about half speed viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. Too bad ... it\\'d nice see good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. Due remarkable variety PC graphics hardware, one viewers might work particular machine. If can\\'t get *any* work, need use one following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, view favorite GIF viewer. (If hi-color hardware, use GIF intermediate format; try find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing hi-color displays.) The Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters FTPable Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip 386 extended memory). These files DOS compilations free source code described section 6B; convert JPEG GIF, Targa, PPM formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These slow limited conversion GIF format; particular, can\\'t get 24-bit color output JPEG. The major advantage tools read write HSI\\'s proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files rather widespread BBSes, useful capability. Version 2.0 tools free (prior versions shareware). Get Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: use HSI format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This translate JPEG files (both JFIF HSI formats) many image formats. It also display images. A demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs non-Unix system weird directory names; document refers directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" Simtel20, really means \"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\". If physically MILnet, expect rather slow FTP transfer rates Simtel20. There several Internet sites maintain copies (mirrors) Simtel20 archives; FTP users go one mirror sites instead. A popular USA mirror site oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), keeps Simtel20 files (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\". If FTP capability, retrieve files Simtel20 e-mail; see informational postings comp.archives.msdos.announce find how. If outside USA, consult newsgroup learn nearest Simtel20 mirror is. Microsoft Windows: There several Windows programs capable displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers generally slower DOS viewers hardware, due Windows\\' system overhead. Note run DOS conversion programs described inside Windows DOS window.) The newest entry WinECJ, free EXTREMELY fast. Version 1.0 available ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer bad habit hogging machine completely decodes; image quality noticeably worse viewers. But fast use anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows BMP format; can\\'t create new JPEG files, view GIFs. JView also lacks useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), excellent basic viewer. The current version, 0.9, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors archive found Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, BMP image files; write formats too, used converter. It nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. The current version 2.1, available Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version; register, get 386-only version, roughly 25% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30). This early promising contender, updated time, point real advantages WinJPEG. If want try anyway, current version 0.97, available ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. (I understand new version appearing authors finished ColorView DOS.) DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works Windows, full-screen mode, window. OS/2: The following files available hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads recent versions --- hobbes moderator fast moving uploads permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version same, OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing PM graphical interface. Strong conversion functions, viewing bit weaker. Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port WinJPEG, popular viewer Windows (see description Windows section). Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer. GIF viewing fast, JPEG viewing fast huge amounts RAM, otherwise speed programs. Strong 24-bit display support. Shareware, $20. Macintosh: Most Mac JPEG programs rely Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, part QuickTime system extension; need QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, need 68020 better CPU need running System 6.0.7 later. (If running System 6, must also install 32-bit QuickDraw extension; built-in System 7.) You get QuickTime FTP ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As 11/92, file contains QuickTime 1.5, better QT 1.0 several ways. With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash fed corrupt JPEG file. However, applications seem compatibility problems QT 1.5.) Mac users keep mind QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section 10 details.) If post images Usenet, make sure JFIF format. Most programs mentioned generate either format. The first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, GIF format. It also convert two JPEG formats. The current version, 2.0, big improvement prior versions. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System 7 QuickTime. On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory Mac viewers; fact, one deal JPEG images much 640x480 pixels typical 4MB Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales fit screen, rather presenting scroll bars like viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like behavior, don\\'t. Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well GIF several image formats. The latest version 2.3.2. Get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, may find worth shareware fee lot playing around images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, best bet machine old run QuickTime. (But faster QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, try converting file GIF JPEG Convert, viewing GIF version. JPEG Convert, Mac version free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, available sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This run Mac, file conversion, viewing. You use conjunction GIF viewer. Previous versions FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, JPEG<=>GIF converter based old version IJG code. If using program, definitely replace JPEG Convert. Apple\\'s free program PictPixie view images JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, GIF format, convert formats. You get PictPixie ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer\\'s tool, really best choice unless like fool around QuickTime. Some drawbacks requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning minor bugs Apple intend fix. (There old version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. If trash it, even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter Kit includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note Picture Compressor NOT free may distributed net.) Storm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program inferior programs many ways, run without System 7 QuickTime, may forced use older systems. (It need 32-bit QuickDraw, really old machines can\\'t use it.) You get sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. You must set file type downloaded image file \\'JPEG\\' allow Picture Decompress open it. If machine old run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus instance), GIFConverter choice single-program JPEG viewing. If want pay GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert free GIF viewer. More commercial Mac applications supporting JPEG, although deal Usenet-standard JFIF format. Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 later, read write JFIF-format JPEG files (use JPEG plug-in Acquire menu). You must set file type downloaded JPEG file \\'JPEG\\' allow Photoshop recognize it. Amiga: (Most programs listed section stored AmiNet archive amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). There many mirror sites archive try use closest one. In USA, good choice wuarchive.wustl.edu; look /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...) HamLab Plus excellent JPEG viewer/converter, well general image manipulation tool. It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) read several formats besides JPEG. The current version 2.0.8. A demo version available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha. The demo version crop images larger 512x512, otherwise fully functional. Rend24 (shareware, $30) image renderer display JPEG, ILBM, GIF images. The program used create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly rendering packages like Lightwave. The current version 1.05, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha. (Note: although directory supposedly AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, program also run AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 2.1.) Viewtek free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer. The current version 1.04, available amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha. If willing spend real money, several commercial packages support JPEG. Two written Thomas Krehbiel, author Rend24 Viewtek. These CineMorph, standalone image morphing package, ImageFX, impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects prepress package also includes CineMorph. Both distributed Great Valley Products. Art Department Professional (ADPro), ASDG Inc, widely used commercial image manipulation software Amigas. ImageMaster, Black Belt Systems, another well-regarded commercial graphics package JPEG support. The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Amigas amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats. The Amiga world heavily infested quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based ancient beta-test version free IJG JPEG software (thanks certain magazine published disk-of-the-month, without much notifying authors). Among \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\", \"VJPEG\", probably others I even heard of. In opinion, anything older IJG version 3 (March 1992) worth disk space stored on; program, trash get something newer. Atari ST: The free IJG JPEG software available compiled Atari ST, TT, etc, atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats. I heard free shareware JPEG-capable viewer Ataris, surely must one now? Pointers appreciated. Acorn Archimedes: !ChangeFSI, supplied RISC OS 3 version 3.10, convert view JPEG JFIF format. Provision also made convert images JPEG, although must done CLI rather double-clicking. Recent versions (since 7.11) shareware program Translator handle JPEG, along 30 image formats. While older versions found Archimedes bboards, current version available registering author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands. Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 10 pounds). There\\'s also commercial product called !JPEG provides JPEG read/write functionality direct JPEG viewing, well host image format conversion processing options. This expensive necessarily better programs. Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK. Tel: 0223 841099. Portable software almost system: If none fits situation, obtain compile free JPEG conversion software described 6B. You\\'ll also need viewer program. If display 8 bits less, GIF viewer fine; display color capability, try find viewer read Targa PPM 24-bit image files. There numerous commercial JPEG offerings, popping every day. I recommend spend money one unless find available free shareware software vastly slow. In case, purchase hardware-assisted product. Ask pointed questions whether product complies final JPEG standard whether handle JFIF file format; many earliest commercial releases never compatible anyone else\\'s files. [6B] If looking source code work with: Free, portable C code JPEG compression available Independent JPEG Group, I lead. A package containing source code, documentation, small test files available several places. The \"official\" archive site source code ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 192.48.96.9). Look directory /graphics/jpeg; current release jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z. (This compressed TAR file; forget retrieve binary mode.) You retrieve file FTP UUCP. If PC know cope .tar.Z format, may prefer ZIP format, find Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip. This file also available CompuServe, GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, jpsrc4.zip. If FTP access, retrieve source nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared issues 55-72 volume 34. (If know retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see FAQ article \"How find sources\", referred top section 6.) The free JPEG code provides conversion JPEG \"JFIF\" format image files GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression decompression modules easily reused programs, image viewers. The package highly portable; tested many machines ranging PCs Crays. We released software noncommercial commercial use. Companies welcome use basis JPEG-related products. We ask royalty, although ask acknowledgement product literature (see README file distribution details). We hope make software industrial-quality --- although, anything that\\'s free, offer warranty accept liability. The Independent JPEG Group volunteer organization; like contribute improving software, welcome join. [7] What\\'s hoopla color quantization? Most people full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 fewer bits per pixel, display 256 fewer distinct colors time. To display full-color image, computer must map image appropriate set representative colors. This process called \"color quantization\". (This something misnomer, \"color selection\" would better term. We\\'re stuck standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. It turns images, details color quantization algorithm MUCH impact final image quality errors introduced JPEG (except lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color GIF JPEG, comes decompressor *not* 256 colors, thousands colors. This happens JPEG\\'s lossiness affects pixel little differently, two pixels started identical colors probably come slightly different colors. Each original color gets \"smeared\" group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. The way avoid quantization ask gray-scale output. (Incidentally, effect nearly meaningless talk number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results roundoff error differences. I occasionally see posted images described \"256-color JPEG\". This tells poster (a) read FAQ (b) probably converted JPEG GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors useful concept JPEG.) On hand, GIF image definition already quantized 256 fewer colors. (A GIF *does* definite number colors palette, format allow 256 palette entries.) For purposes Usenet picture distribution, GIF advantage sender precomputes color quantization, recipients to. This also *disadvantage* GIF: stuck sender\\'s quantization. If sender quantized different number colors display, re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality quantized full-color image. Furthermore, sender use high-quality color quantization algorithm, luck. For reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines match sender\\'s display hardware. JPEG\\'s full color image quantized precisely match user\\'s display hardware. Furthermore, able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there lot active research area), purchase better display hardware, get better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, stuck forevermore sent. It\\'s also worth mentioning many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. If view 256-color GIF 16-color EGA display, example, probably getting much worse image need to. This partly inevitable consequence two color quantizations (one create GIF, one display it), often also due sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs forced use high quality quantizers order get acceptable results all, normal use quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results average GIF program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. For people, GIF already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities display. JPEG images drive displays much effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice GIF representing images machine-independent fashion. [8] How JPEG work? The buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article\\'s long enough already, I\\'m going say here. For technical information, see comp.compression FAQ. This available news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. If need help using news.answers archive, see top article. [9] What lossless JPEG? There\\'s great deal confusion subject. The JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, lossless mode almost nothing common regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. At present, implementations lossless JPEG exist, commercial. Saying \"-Q 100\" free JPEG software DOES NOT get lossless image. What get rid deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With V4 free JPEG code, also say \"-sample 1x1\" turn subsampling. Keep mind many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope resulting file.) Even quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, subject roundoff errors various calculations. The maximum error counts one pixel value; highly unlikely could perceived human eye, might concern machine processing image. At minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. If application requiring lossless storage images less 6 bits per pixel (per color component), may want look JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better JPEG lossless images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images 6 bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG public domain (at least Huffman back end), JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] Why argument file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers family compression algorithms; *not* refer specific image file format. The JPEG committee prevented defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can\\'t actually exchange images anyone else unless agree common file format, leaves us problem. In absence official standards, number JPEG program writers gone \"do thing\", result programs compatible anybody else\\'s. The closest thing de-facto standard JPEG format work that\\'s coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They defined two JPEG-based file formats: * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), \"low-end\" format transports pixels much else. * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF \"high-end\" format let record everything ever wanted know image, lot besides :-). TIFF lot complex JFIF, may well prove less transportable, different vendors historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It\\'s likely adding JPEG mix anything improve situation. Both formats developed input major vendors JPEG-related products; reasonably likely future commercial products adhere one standards. I believe Usenet adopt JFIF replacement GIF picture postings. JFIF simpler TIFF available now; TIFF 6.0 spec recently officially adopted, still unusably vague crucial details. Even TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported \"lowest common denominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never transportable. A particular case people may interested Apple\\'s QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several Mac programs available (see Mac portion section 6A). If editor handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT JFIF hand; see section 11 details. Another particular case Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. By default, though, write proprietary format developed HSI. This format NOT readable non-HSI programs used Usenet postings. Use -j switch get JFIF output. (This applies old versions programs; current releases emit JFIF format default. You still careful post HSI-format files, unless want get flamed people non-PC platforms.) [11] How I recognize file format I have, I it? If alleged JPEG file software read, likely HSI format proprietary JPEG-based format. You tell inspecting first bytes file: 1. A JFIF-standard file start characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0, followed two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed \\'JFIF\\'. 2. If see FF D8 start, rest it, may \"raw JPEG\" file. This probably decodable as-is JFIF software --- worth try, anyway. 3. HSI files start \\'hsi1\\'. You\\'re luck unless HSI software. Portions file may look like plain JPEG data, decompress properly non-HSI programs. 4. A Macintosh PICT file, JPEG-compressed, couple hundred bytes header followed JFIF header (scan \\'JFIF\\'). Strip everything FF D8 able read it. 5. Anything else: proprietary format, JPEG all. If lucky, file may consist header raw JPEG data stream. If identify start JPEG data stream (look FF D8), try stripping everything that. In uuencoded Usenet postings, characteristic JFIF pattern \"begin\" line M_]C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files start \"begin\" line M:\\'-I ... If learn check former, save trouble downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What arithmetic coding? The JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. The choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. On typical images, arithmetic coding produces file 5 10 percent smaller Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses companies. (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images dubious best.) At least short run, I recommend people worry arithmetic coding; space savings great enough justify potential legal hassles. In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There small chance legal situation may change future. Stay tuned details. [13] Does loss accumulate repeated compression/decompression? It would nice if, compressed image JPEG, could decompress it, manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE. In general, recompressing altered image loses information, though usually much lost first time around. The next best thing would decompress image recompress *without changing it* loss, i.e., get identical JPEG file. Even true; least, current free JPEG software. It\\'s essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. If repeatedly compress decompress, image eventually degrade see visible changes first-generation output. (It usually takes many cycles get visible change.) One things to-do list see accumulation error avoided limited, I optimistic it. In case, could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce loss. Even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff-error degradation. (If wondering why, pixel-block boundaries move. If cropped multiples 16 pixels, might safe, that\\'s mighty limited capability!) The bottom line JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. Use lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) working image, JPEG ready file away. Aside avoiding degradation, save lot compression/decompression time way :-). [14] What rules thumb converting GIF images JPEG? As stated earlier, *will* lose amount image information convert existing GIF image JPEG. If obtain original full-color data GIF made from, far better make JPEG that. But need save space GIF work from, suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality. The first rule converting GIF library look JPEG, make sure happy it, throwing away corresponding GIF; give chance re-do conversion higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs may better left GIFs, explained section 3; particular, cartoon-type GIFs sixteen fewer colors convert well. You may find JPEG file reasonable quality *larger* GIF. (So check sizes too.) Experience date suggests large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew storage offer potential savings, convert JPEG least degradation. Don\\'t waste time converting GIF much 100 Kbytes. Also, expect JPEG files converted GIFs small created directly full-color originals. To maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/2 1/3rd size GIF file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people developed odd habit putting large constant-color border around GIF image. While useless, nearly free terms storage cost GIF files. It NOT free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges). Do favor crop border JPEGing. (If X Windows system, XV\\'s manual automatic cropping functions painless way this.) cjpeg\\'s default Q setting 75 appropriate full-color input, GIF inputs, Q settings 85 95 often seem necessary avoid image degradation. (If apply smoothing suggested below, higher Q setting may necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually \"dithered\" fool eye seeing 256 colors GIF actually store. If enlarge image, see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors; normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. The trouble dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; JPEG can\\'t compress noise well. The resulting JPEG file larger lower image quality would gotten JPEGing original full color image (if it). To get around this, want \"smooth\" GIF image compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color thought saw anyway, process getting rid rapid color changes give JPEG trouble. Appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high Q factor, thus reducing size compressed file, still obtaining better-looking output image get without smoothing. With V4 free JPEG software (or products based it), simple smoothing capability built in. Try \"-smooth 10\" converting GIFs. Values 10 25 seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (If see regular fine-scale patterns GIF image even without enlargement, strong smoothing definitely called for.) Too large smoothing factor blur output image, want. If image processing wizard, also smoothing separate filtering program, pnmconvol PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother LOT faster pnmconvol... The upshot \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" probably good starting point converting GIFs.

Gary Suter scored great goal (in fact three Flame goals scored D-men - Yawney Dahlquist getting others), also made bonehead plays. For Kings, Pat Conacher especially impressive. The games VERY chippy, Dan Mirouelli lost control early never recovered it; high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits behind. Fleury got game misconduct rubbing Warren Rychel behind. Flames dominated game physically, failed take advantage due horrendous defensive lapses (I think Vernon blamed goals). Calgary went 7 D-men, Roger Johansson played LW; looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, Sergei Makarov Wednesday's game.

Juhana Kouhia ==clip== [ ..deleted..] Note 'xv' saves 8bit/rasterized images; means saved jpegs like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality. Also, there's three kind 8bit quantizers; final image quality depends too. This situation I read jpeg FAQ ago. IMHO, design error 'xv'; confusing errors programs. There's two errors: -xv allows saving 8bit/rasterized image jpeg even original 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead original 24bit special case -xv allows saving 8bit/rasterized image made quantizer -- main case 'xv' quantizes image best quantizer available saving image file; lousier quantizers viewing purposes (and special cases saving image, all) ==clip== ==clip== [ ..deleted..] It limit *XV*, limit design.

It bad error program program 8bit images time, 24bit image formats included program whole design changed support 24bit images. That done -the program violate jpeg design (and 24bit image format) -the program human interface errors. Otherway drop saving images jpegs 24bit format without clearly saying special case expected normal use. [ ..deleted.. ] ==clip== Some new items follows. ==clip== I seen XV quantizes image sometimes poorly -best24 option default option have. The reason surely quantizer used -best24; (surprise) used ppmquant. If remember, I tested quantizers. In test I found rlequant (with default) best, comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv (our default) order. In test ppmquant suggeeded poorly -- actually gave image bad artifacts. I know ppmquant improved any, I expect no. So, use XV's -best24 option good idea. I suggest author XV changes quantizer one used rlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission. (Another could one used ImageMagick; I tested it, I say nothing it.) ==clip== ==clip== Some minor bugs human interface are: Key pressings cursor clicks goes buffer; Often happens I make click errors press keyboard cursor wrong place. It annoying waited image come five minutes gone away immediately. The buffer cleaned image complete. Also, good idea wait seconds activating keyboard mouse XV image completed. Often happens image pops screen quickly, I'm writing something editor such. Those key pressings go XV image gone something weird. In color editor, I turn color meter release it, XV updates images. It impossible change RGB values first get updated image. It annoying wait image updated setting ready yet. I suggest adding 'apply' button update exchanges done.\",\n",
